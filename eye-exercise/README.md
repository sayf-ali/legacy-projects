# Eye-Exercise

Eye Exercise is a project that largely uses CSS and JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements in order to create a set of balls with a surrounding background that gives the appearance of a pair of eyes that follow the cursor.  Code refactoring was used to add enhancements. Some of the enhancements were:

1. Added gray **Background Color** to the webpage
2. Added **"The Undodgeable Eyes"** heading
3. Added goldenrod **Border** around the black eyes to give appearance of radient irides.

# How to Run the Files
1. Cick the GREEN “Code” button on the Real-Time-Bus-Tracker repository page.
2. Click Download Zip to download the repository files to your local machine.
3. Extract files from the Eye-Exercise repository Zip folder.
4. Drag and drop the index.html file to any browser.


# Future Enhancements
1. Add a gamepiece like a PacMan or Ghost that runs back and forth across the screen
2. Make the eyes follow the gamepiece instead of the cursor
3. Add a mouth that opens and closes with a popup box that displays comments from the eye entity.
4. Have the eye entity fire balls at the gamepiece.
