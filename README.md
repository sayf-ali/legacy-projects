# Legacy Projects Archive

This repository is a **consolidated archive** of projects developed during my foundational training in full-stack web development, including coursework from the **MIT Professional Certificate in Coding (Full Stack MERN)** and independent JavaScript exercises.

These projects reflect my early technical journey and include:

- MIT Capstone: Full-Stack Banking App (MERN)
- PacMen Game & Eye-Tracking Animation (JavaScript/CSS/HTML)
- Real-Time Bus Tracker (JavaScript with Map APIs)
- Portfolio and professional profile pages (HTML/CSS-based)

### Why This Repo Exists

As I evolve into enterprise-focused AI and multi-cloud delivery, I’ve chosen to preserve these projects as a reference point in my developer journey. This archive represents the **foundation** that now supports my work as a:

- Technical Program Manager
- Emerging Azure AI Engineer
- Cloud AI Solution Owner
