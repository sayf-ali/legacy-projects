# Projects Portfolio

This repository hosts the source code and files for my original front-end and JavaScript project showcase site.

These projects were developed during my early training as part of the **MIT Professional Certificate in Full Stack Development (MERN)**, and reflect foundational learning in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

### Included Projects

- **PacMen Animation** – A JavaScript-powered game using timers and DOM manipulation to animate ghost characters
- **Eyes Exercise** – CSS + JS interaction to make animated eyes follow mouse movement
- **Real-Time Bus Tracker** – An API-integrated map tracker showing live MTA bus location updates

**Note:** This repo is archived as part of my `legacy-projects` consolidation and no longer actively maintained.
