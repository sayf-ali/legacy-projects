# PacMen-Exercise

PacMen Exercise is a project that largely uses JavaScript and some CSS to display buttons that use a factory to produce and animate Blue Ghosts that randomly move across the screen; as well as activate a PacMan game piece that moves back and forth horizontally across the screen.  Open source code was used as a starter. Some of the following enhancements were added:

1. Added blue **Background Color** to the buttons.
2. Created **Blue Ghost Factory**. 

# How to Run the Files
1. Cick the GREEN “Code” button on the Real-Time-Bus-Tracker repository page.
2. Click Download Zip to download the repository files to your local machine.
3. Extract files from the Eye-Exercise repository Zip folder.
4. Drag and drop the index.html file to any browser.


# Future Enhancements
1. Add **Random Factory** to generate other color Ghosts.
2. Add **Canvas** to set boundaries and board animation.
3. Add **Obstacles** for PacMan to navigate.
4. Add **Collision** functionality between PacMan and Ghosts that stops the game.
5. Add **Controllers** for PacMan game piece to dodge Ghosts.
6. Add **Titles** and some "donk" **Sound Effects** upon collision.
7. Add **Timer** and **Game Points**.
