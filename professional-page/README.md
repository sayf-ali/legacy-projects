# Professional Portfolio Site (Legacy)

This repository contains the HTML/CSS/JS source for my **original GitHub-hosted professional portfolio site**, designed and developed before transitioning into AI and cloud engineering roles.

The site includes:
- A summary of my past cloud consulting experience
- Visuals of client industries and projects
- Video presentation embeds from MITâ€™s capstone course
- Links to MERN stack and front-end demonstration projects

This page served as a personal portfolio for early career branding and technical proof of concept. It is now maintained as an archive under `legacy-projects` and will be replaced by future GenAI and cloud project showcases.
