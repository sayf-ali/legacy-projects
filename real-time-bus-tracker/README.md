# Real-Time Bus Tracker

Real-Time Bus Tracker is a project that maps an animated bus marker passing by a set of bus-stops along New York City's M55 bus route from Bryant Park to South Ferry in Lower Manhattan.  Existing code through APIs from Mapbox and the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) was leveraged in this project as a starter.  Code refactoring was used to add enhancements. Some of the enhancements were:

1. **Map Tilting** through Pitch and Bearing Properties
2. **Gradient Line** through Map Layering
3. **Coordinate Circles** through Map Layering to Correspond with Bus-stops
4. **Hover Over Bus-stop Marker Popups** that display information related to the route, names of neighborhoods, public parks in close proximity, and well-known tourist attractions and popular places of interest.

# How to Run the Files
1. Cick the GREEN “Code” button on the Real-Time-Bus-Tracker repository page.

# Future Enhancements
1. Add relevant pictures to each bus-stop popup
2. Add 3D mapping to show building elevations.
